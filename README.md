# Search-for-people-in-images
3 sets of images are given: training (train), validation (valid) and test (test). The task is to find on the test set which of the images contain people.

The markup is known for the training and validation sets. It is set in the train.csv and valid.csv files. Each of these files contains 2 columns:
id- the name of the file with the image
target_people is equal to 1 if the image contains at least one person and 0 if it does not.
